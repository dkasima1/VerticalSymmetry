The experiments run on Python version 2.7.11 because at this time, Psychopy2 only supported python2
and this was the IDE we needed to run our code in for our research. The instructions of each experiment
is presented when the experiment is run.

You can run this experiment easily by opening the folder Vertical_Symmetry and then running any of the python files
within that are one of the three experiments (SamenessSamePairs, SamenessDiffPairs, SamenessHalfPairs). The data is
stored in folders of the same name as the experiment with the extension DATA.

In this set of experiments, we test a participants visual asymmetry, i.e. we test how fast they can perform
visual search under different conditions. 

SamenessSamePairs - Tests visual asymmetry among pairs of letters where the background (non-target) stimuli
are initially all the same matching pair in one condition (such as AA) and the target is a pair of different
letters (for example GF). In the second condition, the situations are reversed. The background is uniformly of
a pair that does not contain two of the same letters, and the target is a pair with identical letters.

SamenessDiffPairs - Similar to the experiment above, but instead of the background being uniform, all the pairs
are different. This is a more difficult version of the task above.

SamenessHalfPairs - Similar to the situations above but this time the target stimuli will have one letter matching
that of the background. This is the hardest version of this task.
